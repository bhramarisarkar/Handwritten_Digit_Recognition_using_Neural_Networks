**Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks**

This repository implements a neural network from scratch for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. 

**What's Here?**

* A well-structured and documented Python codebase for building and training a neural network for handwritten digit classification. 
* Clear explanations within the code for understanding each step.
* Utilization of basic libraries like pandas (data manipulation) and numpy (numerical computations) for efficiency and ease of use.
* Achieves an accuracy of approximately 94.38% on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented model.

**Understanding the Code**

The code is divided into sections for better readability:

1. **Introduction:** Briefly describes the project's purpose and the significance of handwritten digit recognition.
2. **Methodology:**
    * **Dataset:** Explains the MNIST dataset and its characteristics.
    * **Classification Algorithm:** Details the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for classification. 
        * Explains the concept of neurons, layers (input, hidden, output), and activation functions (ReLU and Softmax).
    * **Training Process:** Describes the training data split (training vs testing/validation) and the number of iterations used.
3. **Implementation:**
    * **Libraries:**  Highlights the use of pandas and numpy.
    * **Neural Network Architecture:**
        * **Input Layer:**  Explains the connection to the MNIST image size (28x28 pixels) and the number of nodes (784).
        * **Hidden Layer:**  Details the presence of a single hidden layer with 10 nodes using the ReLU activation function.
        * **Output Layer:** Explains the 10 output nodes (one for each digit) and the use of the Softmax activation function for probability distribution.
4. **Results:** 
    * Showcases the achieved accuracy (around 94%) on the MNIST dataset.
    * Emphasizes the success of a simple ANN model compared to more complex ones.
5. **Conclusion:**
    * Summarizes the project's achievements in building and training a neural network for handwritten digit recognition.
    * Highlights the potential applications in real-world scenarios like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and automated data entry.
    * Acknowledges the possibility of extending and optimizing the framework for more complex tasks.
    * Emphasizes the value of continued exploration of neural network methodologies for advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
6. **References:** Provides a list of resources used for the project.

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/bhramarisarkar/Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_using_Neural_Networks.git`
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy` (assuming you have pip installed)
3. Run the script: `python main.py` (replace `main.py` with the actual script name if different)

**Further Exploration**

* Experiment with different network architectures (number of hidden layers, nodes per layer).
* Explore various activation functions beyond ReLU and Softmax.
* Implement data preprocessing techniques for potentially higher accuracy.
* Visualize the training process (loss curves, accuracy trends).
